## Problem
Working from home comes with a myriad of challenges that more and more people find themselves facing every day. With the need for social distancing in the midst of the pandemic, more people are working and studying from home, despite being unprepared to do so. For many,  it is becoming increasingly difficult to stay productive as the line between the spaces of productivity and relaxation are blurred. The inability to compartmentalize spaces makes it hard to find the motivation needed to complete tasks that need to be done.
