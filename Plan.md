# Plan

## Coordination
* Who will coordinate the work?
    * Madison, our Project Manager, will coordinate all work.
* What will their project management practices be? 
    * Trello will be our primary task manager, where, whenever possible, each task will be assigned an owner, a title, & a due date, as Trello is a) designed for smaller projects like ours and b) something many in the team are familiar with.
    * Major milestones (e.g. Assignment deadlines) in GitHub Issues in order to have a simplified view of major deadlines.
* Will you have meetings? How frequently? Who plans their agendas? 
    * We will meet at least once per week on Saturdays at noon. Additional meetings will be planned as needed.
    * Madison will plan out meetings agendas to be posted on Drive in folder “Meeting Agendas”
        * Agendas will include order of topics to be discussed, any action items that must be completed, and any other topics that need to be addressed as a group.
* What tools will you use to communicate?
    * Slack for primary communication, with @channel for time-sensitive, critical messages, since our class has already been set up on Slack & we all check Slack regularly.
    * Zoom for all meetings, since we are well-acquainted with Zoom from class sessions.
